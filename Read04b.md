### What make a computer, a computer?
- the idea start from building a machine for thinking work rather than any physical work.
- the best four things common in all computers in the world are:
  - **Input** 
  - **storage**
  - **Processing**
  - **Output**

## How computer work?
 ### Data + Binary
   - Inside a computer there are electric wires and circuits that carry information in the computer.
   - the electricity flowing through the single wires
   - the signal have two choices: YES(ON) or NO(OFF)
   - This on/off state of a single wire called **Bit**
  ### circuits and logic
   - To process the input into output we have to modify and combine the input signals.
   - this done by circuits which are teeny electronic coponents comes togaher 
   - small circuits perform simple logical calculation
   - complex circuits combined small circuits togather to perform complex calculation.
   - the speciality of these calculation are **Faster than human**.
