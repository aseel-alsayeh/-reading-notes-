### Forms
- HTML form elements work a bit differently from other DOM elements in React.
- In React, mutable state is typically kept in the state property of components, and only updated with setState().
-  #### “controlled component” 
   -  An input form element whose value is controlled by React.
- The textarea Tag :
  - In HTML, a <textarea> element defines its text by its children.
  - In React, a <textarea> uses a value attribute instead. This way, a form using a <textarea> can be written very similarly to a form that uses a single-line input.

- the select tag :
  - In HTML, <select> creates a drop-down list. For example, this HTML creates a drop-down list of flavors.
  - Note that the Coconut option is initially selected, because of the selected attribute. React, instead of using this selected attribute, uses a value attribute on the root select tag. This is more convenient in a controlled component because you only need to update it in one place.
