### ch4 : links
- Links are created using the <a> element.

### ch15 : layout 
- CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.
- block-level element.
   -Examples include: <h1> <p> <ul> <li>
- Inline-level element.
   - Examples include: <img> <b> <i> 
- When you move any element from normal flow, boxes can overlap. The z-index property allows you to control which box appears on top.
- Relative positioning moves an element in relation to where it would have been in normal flow.

### ch 3 : Function method and objects 
- Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a 
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can 
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).
