- Who is Roy Fielding?
  He helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet.

- Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

- What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?


- What does a GET do?
The web page just specifies the URLs to the images,text,.. and the browser goes and does more GETs using the HTTP protocol on them until all the resources are obtained and the web page is displayed.
- What does a POST do?
- What does PUT do?
- What does PATCH do?
