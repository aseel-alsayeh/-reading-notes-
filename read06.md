###Chapter 3: “Object Literals”
- complex scripts can run to hundreds (even thousands) of lines. Programmers use 
functions, methods, and objects to organize their code.
- Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object, variables and functions take on new names.
- IN AN OBJECT: VARIABLES BECOME KNOWN AS PROPERTIES, FUNCTIONS BECOME KNOWN AS METHODS 
- there are several way to create objects:
    - literal notation is the easiest and most popular way to create objects.
    var object = {
        key:value
        cheackAaialbility : function(){
            return this.key - this.key;
        }
    };

- you access the properties or methods of an object using dot notation.you can access properitis using square brackets.
   - var objectKey= object.key;
   - var objectKey= object['key'];
