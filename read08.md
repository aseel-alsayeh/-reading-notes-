# layout
- web designers often try to create pages of around 960-1000 pixels wide 
(since most users will be able to see designs this wide on their screens).
- Liquid layout designs stretch and contract as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser 
window. They tend to use percentages.
- Fixed width layout designs do not change size as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window. 
Measurements tend to be given in pixels.
